The results for this assignment are contained in SQLTasks Tier 1.sql and in SQLTasksSQLite.ipynb notebook.  I ended up creating my own database connection using SQLAlchemy as the one provided didn't seem to provide any output for some reason.  Additionally, the queries were designed and run on a MySQL local installation as it seems the PHP one kept erroring on valid queries.
