/* Welcome to the SQL mini project. You will carry out this project partly in
the PHPMyAdmin interface, and partly in Jupyter via a PythON cONnectiON.

This is Tier 1 of the CASE study, which means that there'll be more guidance for you about how to 
setup your local SQLite cONnectiON in PART 2 of the CASE study. 

The questiONs in the CASE study are exactly the same AS with Tier 2. 

PART 1: PHPMyAdmin
You will complete questiONs 1-9 below in the PHPMyAdmin interface. 
Log in by pASting the following URL into your browser, and
using the following Username and PASsword:

URL: https://sql.springboard.com/
Username: student
PASsword: learn_sql@springboard

The data you need is in the "country_club" databASe. This databASe
cONtains 3 tables:
    i) the "Bookings" table,
    ii) the "Facilities" table, and
    iii) the "Members" table.

In this CASE study, you'll be ASked a series of questiONs. You can
solve them using the platform, but for the final deliverable,
pASte the code for each solutiON into this script, and upload it
to your GitHub.

Before starting with the questiONs, feel free to take your time,
exploring the data, and getting acquainted with the 3 tables. */

/* PART 2: SQLite
/* We now want you to jump over to a local instance of the database ON your machine. 

Copy and paste the LocalSQLConnection.py script into an empty Jupyter notebook, and run it. 

Make sure that the SQLFiles folder containing these files is in your working directory, and
that you haven't changed the name of the .db file from 'sqlite\db\pythonsqlite'.

You should see the output FROM the initial query 'SELECT * FROM FACILITIES'.

Complete the remaining tasks in the Jupyter interface. If you struggle, feel free to go back
to the PHPMyAdmin interface as and when you need to. 

You'll need to paste your query into value of the 'query1' variable and run the code block again to get an output.
